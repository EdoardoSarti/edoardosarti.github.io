## [EncoMPASS: Encyclopedia of Membrane Proteins Analyed by Structure and Symmetry](https://encompass.ninds.nih.gov/)

EncoMPASS collects and relates the sequence, structure, ans internal and quaternary symmetries of all transmembrane proteins of known structures. 
Taking its data from the PDB, OPM, and PDBTM, it includes several curated analyses that render the database a versatile and reliable benchmark, other than a useful resource for the molecular biologist.

## [AlignMe](https://www.bioinfo.mpg.de/AlignMe/)

Pairwise alignment webserver that generalizes the Waterman-Smith algorithm by allowing a diversity of data to be integrated in the form of profile scores. Especially suited for transmembrane proteins, AlignMe is able to return accurate pairwise alignment of low-similarity sequences.
