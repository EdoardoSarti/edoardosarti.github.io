I am a tenured research scientist (CR) in the [ABS](https://team.inria.fr/abs/) team of Inria Université Côte d’Azur. Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology (LCQB) at Sorbonne University (Paris, France), and in the Computational Structural Biology (CSB) Lab at NIH (Bethesda, MD, USA). 

I obtained my BSc and MSc in Physics at Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy), and I obtained my PhD in Molecular and Statistical Biophysics in SISSA (Trieste, Italy).

My research is about conceiving new algorithms for the study of the structure, dynamics, and evolution of proteins. I particularly focus on the characterization of transmembrane proteins, orphan proteins, and other classes of proteins in the twilight zone of applicability of AI-driven methods. I am also interested in foundational aspects of machine learning algorithms.
