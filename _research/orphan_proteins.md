Proteins with no identified homologs (and thus not belonging to any protein family) are called orphans. Orphan proteins are present in every species, spanning from about 5 to 35% of the proteome.
"Orphan" is an umbrella definition including unrelated evolutionary events. Orphan proteins can:
- have emerged recently (we talk thus of _de novo_ proteins)
- have diverged considerably from the family they belong (divergent homologs, usually considered as more frequent than _de novo_ proteins)
